For video processing: When using cv2.VideoCapture(), you need to provide the file path of the video you want to process. Replace "D:\photes\New folder\new.mp4" with the exact file location of your video. For example:
python
Copy code
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(r"your_video_file_path_here.mp4")
For image processing: When using cv2.imread(), you need to provide the file path of the image you want to process. Replace "D:\photes\photo_2024-03-09_17-37-55.jpg" with the exact file location of your image. For example:
python
Copy code
img = cv2.imread(r"your_image_file_path_here.jpg")
In both cases, the 'r' prefix before the string literal is used to create a raw string, which allows backslashes \ to be treated as literal characters rather than escape characters. This is important, especially in file paths on Windows systems, where backslashes are commonly used as path separators.
